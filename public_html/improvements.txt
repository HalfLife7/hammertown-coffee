1. Fixed bug for when .places query did not have that specific item.
	Before: 
		- If a marker was clicked and that place did not have any photos, the old photos would stay there.
	After: 
		- Hide that particular element if .place query did not have it so that information from previous location was not displayed.
	
2. Updated introduction. Added a logo and a description of what the user can do.
	Increased amount of coffee shop markers while maintaining places query accuracy.

3. Fixed some issues with mobile.
	- Before: 
		- Introduction container did not take 100% width
		- Background colour was not uniform for introduction container: there was white outside the box.
	- After:
		- Introduction container now takes 100% width
		- Background colour is now all grey
		
4. 	Fixed responsive design, added header on top to display application name.
